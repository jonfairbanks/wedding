	- Be careful in San Francisco! Unfortunately San Francisco has *very* high crime as of late.
		- Do not leave ANY items in your car under any circumstances (food, jackets, phone cables, etc.)
		- Thieves can tell if electronics (phones, computers, cameras) have been left in your car, even if in a trunk or under something.
		- Use [SpotHero](https://spothero.com/city/san-francisco-parking) and pay to park your vehicle somewhere safe (ex: a hotel). If necessary, take a Lyft from your parked car to more touristy areas.
		- Be aware of your surroundings!
	- With that being said, San Francisco is an international city with tons of cool sights
